; This code must be executed after the "Create Pokemon species from nothing" code, with the species set to 0x45B7.
; After that, you should not modify the names of the boxes 11-14 (they must be the same for this code).
; Then, put any pokemon with the name [xâ™‚zN 6FFxC] in the box 10 slot 20.
; At this point, you should save your game and reload your save in order to reinitialize the value of some registers.
; Then, write this code (boxes 1-10) and execute it by viewing the summary of the 0x45B7 species.
; The pokemon in box 10 slot 20 will be transformed into a bad egg.
; This bad egg must be placed somewhere in Box 12 (not the first row), Box 13 or Box 14
; when you want to execute an ARM ACE code by viewing the summary of the 0x45B7 species.
